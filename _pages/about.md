I'm a Ph.D. candidate at the [Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS)](https://inrs.ca/), Université du Québec, in Montreal. My research focuses in understanding and improving neural networks ability to handle out-of-distribution data. I'm also interested in generative modeling, multi-objective optimization, and applications of machine learning to medical data. I'm from Brazil and (very proudly) from [Recife-PE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recife). Prior to joining INRS, I received a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the Federal University of Pernambuco and a Master's degree in Computer Engineering from the University of Pernambuco, both in Recife.
